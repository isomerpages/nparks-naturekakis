<p>In support of the <a href="/nature-kakis-network/programmes-and-activities/">OneMillionTrees Movement</a>, the Punggol Coast Nature Kakis co-organised a tree-planting event with NParks where the Nature Kakis facilitators guided Punggol residents to plant trees alongside Punggol North Avenue on 24 September 2023.</p>

<p>Grassroots Adviser, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, joined around 80 of the residents, a good mix of young families and seniors from the Punggol Active Ageing Committee, to plant a total of 60 trees.</p>

<p>The Punggol Coast Nature Kakis (in white) not only taught residents about how to plant trees, but also why they are important, and the role they play in our City In Nature. </p>
<p>The tree species planted were <em>Ardisia elliptica, Tarenna fragrans</em> and <em>Memecylon ovatum</em>.</p>
<p>Insert a short blurb about each tree species here? Something about trees lah</p>
