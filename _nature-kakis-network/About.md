# What is the Nature Kakis Network?
<section>
<p>    
Over the years, the community has played a pivotal role in greening up Singapore and conserving our natural heritage. Even today, the community continues to be active in City in Nature initiatives, programmes and activities, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to preserving our environment and promoting sustainable living. </p>

<p> Established by National Parks Board (NParks), the Nature Kakis Network is a platform that provides opportunities for members of the public to participate in City in Nature-related initiatives and activities. This initiative is centred at the heart of local communities, with the goal of making nature-related programmes and activities more accessible to the wider community. </p><br>

<p> Currently, Nature Kakis chapters are being established in every precinct, allowing individuals to self-organise and lead programmes for the community, with support from partners, grassroot organisations, and agencies including NParks and Peopleâ€™s Association. Each Nature Kakis Chapter will be community-driven and bring together individuals who share a passion for nature and conservation. </p>

<p> By fostering a sense of community and encouraging greater appreciation and stewardship for our natural heritage, Nature Kakis Network aims to grow our City in Nature in the heartlands and empower individuals to become stewards of nature. </p>
