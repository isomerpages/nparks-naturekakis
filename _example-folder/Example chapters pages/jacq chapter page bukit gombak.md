<p>Bukit Gombak Nature Kakis are volunteers who are keen on engaging the elderly staying in the Bukit Gombak area via greenery-related events. Trained in <a href="">Therapeutic Horticulture</a>, the Bukit Gombak Nature Kakis have since run a <a href="">Therapeutic horticulture session at Bedok Reservoir park</a> to teach residents how making scent bags help with motor control and mental focus.</p>
