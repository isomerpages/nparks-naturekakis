With habitats ranging from primary forests in our nature reserves, mangroves and seagrass along our coastlines, and even greenery among our urban cityscapes, wildlife has become an integral part of our City in Nature.</p><p>Nature Kakis are an important conduit for residents to learn more about wildlife on our island. By bringing their communities to see animals via <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Walks</a>, painting homages to them as part of <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-in-neighbourhood/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature in Neighbourhood</a> projects, and planting <a href="https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">biodiversity-attracting plants</a> as part of <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-in-bloom/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community In Bloom</a> or <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/tree-planting/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OneMillionTrees</a>, Nature Kakis Chapters have been providing opportunities for Singaporeans to learn about local wildlife from their peers. This role also extends into educating communities about how to behave around wildlife, which is integral in managing <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/dos-and-donts/animal-advisories" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">human-wildlife conflict.</a></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BioD &amp; wildlife/BioDandWildlife__1__Resized.jpg"></div><p>Nature Kakis chapters can get started in learning about local biodiversity by joining a <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/community-in-nature-initiative/citizen-science-programmes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Citizen Science Survey</a>, which covers birds, butterflies, dragonflies, and marine animals in intertidal areas. By learning to identify and document these animals, Nature Kakis can then use these skills to teach others in their community, and become more aware of the wildlife around them.</p><p>Interested to bring wildlife to your community?
