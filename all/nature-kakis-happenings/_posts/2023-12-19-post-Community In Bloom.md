<p>Community In Bloom is a nationwide gardening programme that helps to start and develop Community Gardens in public and private estates, schools, and organisations. Nature Kakis chapters can join and collaborate with Community Gardens to engage communities about gardening, or other City In Nature themes like Biodiversity and Therapeutic Horticulture by growing the appropriate plants.</p><p></p>
