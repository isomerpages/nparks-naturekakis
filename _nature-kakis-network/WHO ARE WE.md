<p>Over the years, the community has played a pivotal role in greening up
Singapore and conserving our natural heritage. Even today, the community
continues to be active in City in Nature initiatives, programmes and activities,
demonstrating their unwavering commitment to preserving our environment
and promoting sustainable living.</p>
<p>Nature Kakis Network is a platform that provides opportunities for members
of the public to participate in City in Nature-related initiatives and
activities. This initiative is centred at the heart of local communities,
with the goal of making nature-related programmes and activities more accessible
to the wider community.</p>

<p>We aim to establish Nature Kakis chapters in every precinct that can self-organise
and lead programmes for the community and by the community, with support
from partners, grassroots organisations and agencies including National
Parks Board (NParks) and Peopleâ€™s Association (PA). Each Nature Kakis chapter
will be community-driven and bring together individuals who share a passion
for nature and conservation.</p>
