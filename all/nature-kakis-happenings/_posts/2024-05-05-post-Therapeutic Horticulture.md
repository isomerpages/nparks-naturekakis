By interacting with nature, participants can improve their motor skills, stimulate their memory, and encourage positive social interactions with nature. Therapeutic Horticulture is particularly effective in engaging the elderly, people with dementia, and people with special needs. Nature Kakis Chapters can learn how to conduct Therapeutic Horticulture activities, bring communities to Therapeutic Gardens, and even incorporate Therapeutic Garden elements closer to home to bring these benefits to their communities.</p><h3>Therapeutic Horticulture Activities</h3><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/TH Activities/TheapeuticHorticulture__4__Resized.jpg"></div><p>Simple activities like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix79Y-vnjyc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">propagating plants</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUxJNTL2m-A" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">leaf printing</a>, and making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3255iKu9lo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">seed mandalas</a> are easy activities for communities to do together, with materials that can be easily grown and harvested from a nearby <a href="all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-in-bloom/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community Garden</a>. Nature Kakis can learn how to <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/therapeutic-gardens/how-to-start-a-therapeutic-horticulture-programme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">conduct these activities</a>, and bring the benefits of Therapeutic Horticulture to their communities.</p><h3>Therapeutic Gardens</h3><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/TH Activities/9__Seating_area_with_wheelchair_provision.jpg"></div><p>In addition to the activities, Nature Kakis could go for a <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Walk</a> in a <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/therapeutic-gardens" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Therapeutic Garden</a> located in a public park. These gardens are specially designed to be serene and tranquil, serving as a key space of people to interact with nature in a positive way. In addition to being wheelchair-accessible, many of these gardens feature activity zones where Nature Kakis Chapters can conduct Therapeutic Horticulture Activities.</p><p>If Nature Kakis Chapters are keen on bringing the gardens closer to home, they can integrate <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/therapeutic-gardens/how-to-start-a-therapeutic-garden" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Therapeutic Design concepts</a> in their <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-in-bloom/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community Gardens</a>, or as part of a <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-in-neighbourhood/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature In Neighbourhood</a> project.</p><p></p>
