In addition to being edible, plants can be grown to support <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/biodiversity-and-wildlife/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">wildlife</a>, to be used in <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/therapeutic-horticulture/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">therapeutic horticulture</a>, and to be shared as cuttings or seeds with the community. Community Gardens have lots of potential to be a starting point for communities to learn about our City in Nature!</p><p>Other than directly growing plants, Nature Kakis can also work with <a href="https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/programming/cib-ambassadors/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community In Bloom Ambassadors</a>, who are passionate volunteers that go above and beyond to spread the love of gardening.</p><h3>Community In Bloom projects</h3><h4>Garden Open Houses</h4><p>Having an open house at a Community Garden is a great way to bring people together to learn more about plants and greenery!</p><h4>Harvest sharing</h4><p>By coordinating the growing of <a href="https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/glossary/edible-plants/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">edible plants</a> between gardens, Nature Kaki chapters can organise a harvest sharing event with other community groups.</p><h4>Planting for biodiversity</h4><p>Growing <a href="https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">plants that provide food and nesting materials</a> for local biodiversity can introduce communities wildlife like butterflies, bees, and birds.</p><p>Keen on growing your community's love for gardening?
