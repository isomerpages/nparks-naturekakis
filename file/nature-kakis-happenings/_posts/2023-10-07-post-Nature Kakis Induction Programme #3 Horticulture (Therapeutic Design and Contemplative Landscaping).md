	<p align="justify">On the 7 October 2023 (Saturday), the Community Projects teams (Planning &amp; Programme and Engagement) from the Horticulture &amp; Community Division organised the third Nature Kakis Induction Programme at Jurong Lake Gardens, Gardenhouse, Mempat Hall. The event was attended by 40 Nature Kakis and CIB ambassadors. The central focus of the event was on horticulture, with a sub-topic focus on therapeutic design and contemplative landscaping. The topic of Horticulture is one of four induction topics that will be covered annually to improve the capabilities of Nature Kakis in organising community activities.</p>

<p align="justify">Ms Sophianne Araib (GD/Pks Ctrl &amp; HCG), commenced the Induction Programme with a warm welcome to the attendees. She provided an overview of Nature Kakis Network by covering the number of existing and new established Nature Kakis chapters and activities conducted by Nature Kakis to date. Following the introduction, Mr Woo Wee Meng (D/Community Projects (Planning &amp; Programme) shared updates on some of the key activities that the Nature Kakis conducted from June to August before introducing the day's induction programme.</p>
<p align="justify">The first session of the event featured a talk on contemplative landscaping by Mr Jason Wright (D/Design). The talk focused on how to create therapeutic landscapes in areas with space constraints that are too small to be developed into a full-fledged therapeutic garden. Following the talk, Mr Wright led an interactive activity that allowed participants to apply what they had learned and graded different landscape designs based on the design guidelines for contemplative landscaping.</p>

<p align="justify">The second session was led by Mr Paul Bhathal (Snr Mgr/H&amp;C), who gave a talk on Therapeutic Gardens and Therapeutic Horticulture. The session included a hands-on activity called the Interactive Scent Bag Making Therapeutic Programming, which was led by expert facilitators. During the activity, participants had the opportunity to create their own scent bags using natural materials and learn about the therapeutic properties of different scents. The facilitators provided insights on the science behind the scents and its effects on the mind and body.</p>
<p align="justify">At the end of the session, the emcee thanked the speakers and facilitators for their contributions in making the event a success, as well as the participants for their enthusiasm and active participation during the induction programme.</p>
<p align="justify">Overall, the participants gained valuable knowledge about horticulture and had the opportunity to apply their learning in a hands-on activity. We would like to thank all the speakers and facilitators for making the programme a success.</p></section>
