<p align="justify">Nature Kakis chapters can explore a wide variety of activities and programmes, such as those listed below. These programmes and activities cater to a diverse range of interests and skill levels, as well as provide a starting point for Nature Kakis chapters to explore new activities for their community. Although the programmes is not exhaustive, it serves as a source of inspiration for chapters to kickstart new programmes and/or improve existing ones. </p><br>
