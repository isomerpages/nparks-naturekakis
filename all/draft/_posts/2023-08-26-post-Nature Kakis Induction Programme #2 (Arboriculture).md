<section><p align="justify">On 26 August 2023, National Parks Board (NParks) organised the Nature Kakis Induction Programme #2 at Jurong Lake Gardens (JLG), Garden House, Mempat Hall. The event was attended by 44 Nature Kakis and Community in Bloom ambassadors, and it had a central focus on arboriculture. This topic is one of the four that will be held annually to enhance the capabilities of the Nature Kakis in organising community activities. </p>

<p align="justify">The Induction Programme was commenced with a warm welcome to the attendees. Following the introduction, the opening remarks were delivered and the attendees were provided with a clear understanding of the Induction Programmeâ€™s purpose and importance. </p>
	
<p align="justify">The Induction Programme proceeded with a refreshing morning tour at Rasau, which was thoughtfully organised by the JLG team. During the tour, participants had the opportunity to learn about various aspects of arboriculture, including ecological resilience, the building of forest ecology, and the development of the Jurong Lake District into a landscaped area. The participants were introduced to the different tree species in the area and their ecological significance, which provided them with a deeper understanding of the importance of preserving and protecting the environment. Overall, the tour was an enriching experience that allowed participants to gain valuable insights into the world of arboriculture.</p>

<p align="justify">The first talk on arboriculture focused on the importance of trees in urban environments and provided an insightful overview of the Garden City Story. The talk featured how Singapore evolved from a Garden City to a City in Garden and finally to a City in Nature, highlighting the significance of trees in shaping Singapore's landscape and identity.</p>

<p align="justify">The second talk aimed to educate and inspire attendees about native trees, as native flora and fauna hold significant ecological value in building ecological resilience. The participants were provided with an in-depth understanding of the importance of native trees in preserving biodiversity and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Aside from the talks, NParks Design team put in a lot of effort to create a fun and educational hands-on activity for the participants. The activity was designed to provide participants with a hands-on experience in developing three different types of sites: educational/learning centres, ecologically sensitive areas, and residential/dwelling areas. The participants were divided into groups to play the roles of both developers and users, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and considerations involved in developing these sites. The activity was well-received by the participants, who found it to be both engaging and informative.</p>

The participants gained valuable knowledge about arboriculture and had the opportunity to apply their learning in a hands-on activity. We would like to thank all the speakers, tour guides, and facilitators for their contributions to the programme. We look forward to organising more events like this in the future.</p></section>
