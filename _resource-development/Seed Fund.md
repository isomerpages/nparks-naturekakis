<h3>Nature Kakis Network Seed Fund</h3>
<p><strong><u>Objectives</u></strong>
</p>
<p>With the Nature Kakis Network serving as a platform that accelerates the
mainstreaming of City in Nature initiatives within wider heartland communities,
the Nature Kakis Network Seed Fund supports the development and building
of the network, the training of Nature Kakis to self-organize activities,
and the organization of recurring Nature Kakis activities and events.</p>
<p><strong><u>Eligibility</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To apply, the chapter must first be an <strong>established Nature Kakis chapter</strong> that
has received appointment letters from National Parks Board (NParks).</p>
<p>Interested established chapters are encouraged to apply for the Seed Fund
early, as it operates on a first-come, first-served basis and is subject
to the availability of funds.</p>
<p><strong><u>Fund Details</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This Seed Fund provides funding of <strong>up to $5,000* per Nature Kakis chapter</strong>,
and there will be a<strong> full reimbursement </strong>of fundable items
made to the respective <strong>Citizens’ Consultative Committee (CCC) </strong>supporting
each chapter. The use of funds for projects will be assessed based on the
project’s merits and ability to contribute towards the Nature Kakis Network
and chapter growth.</p>
<p>You may refer to the infographics below on fundable items^ and book a
virtual consultation with us through your NParks Community Projects (Engagement)
manager today.
