<p>The Nature Kakis initiative is a network of chapters that form touchpoints
centred at the heart of local communities. This platform aims to accelerate
the mainstreaming of City in Nature programmes into the heartlands to encourage
greater appreciation and community stewardship of nature. We aim to establish
Nature Kakis Chapters island-wide to self-organise and lead projects, for
the community, by the community, with support from partners, grassroots
organisations and agencies including National Parks Board (NParks) and
Peopleâ€™s Association (PA). Each Nature Kakis Chapter will be community-driven
and bring together individuals who share a passion for nature and conservation.</p>
