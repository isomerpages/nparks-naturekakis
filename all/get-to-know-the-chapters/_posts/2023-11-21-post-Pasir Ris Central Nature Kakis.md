<p>Nature is at the heart of Pasir Ris, and Nature Kakis Pasir Ris Central is on a mission to bring our beach town's natural beauty and rich biodiversity even closer to the community. They offer a range of nature-based programmes,  including <a href="">guided walks</a>, <a href="">tree-planting</a>, and <a href="">gardening exchanges</a>. Through these activities,  they aim to inspire more residents to learn more about and appreciate Singapore's diverse flora and fauna, turning their butter fingers into green fingers!</p>
