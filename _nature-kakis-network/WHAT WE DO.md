<p>Nature Kakis chapters drive community-led nature programmes, activities,
and projects, bringing our City In Nature to their communities. Nature
Kakis can participate in and also go one step further to help grow community
interest by planning, organizing and implementing a wide variety of activities
and programmes.</p>
<p><strong>If you'd like to discover more about the Nature Kakis activities, we invite you to follow us on Instagram (@NatureKakis_Network) and like our Facebook page (Nature Kakis Network) for the latest updates and to be part of our nature-loving community.</strong>

<p>Promoting responsible pet ownership and community animal caregiving is
essential for improving animal health and welfare in our urban environment.
Nature Kakis chapters can conduct educational outreach to raise awareness
of current pet care guidelines and etiquette, while encouraging responsible
practices towards community animals. This initiative aims to engage and
educate the community on responsible pet ownership, cultivate neighbourliness
and tolerance for pets and community animals, and address animal-related
issues within the community.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Educational Outreach Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Responsible pet ownership</u>
</p>
<p>Nature Kakis can organize educational programmes for current and potential
pet owners, focusing on responsible pet ownership and spreading awareness
of AVS guidelines and recommedations for pet care. These guidelines may
cover topics such as:</p>
<p>§ Considerations or pet ownership&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Sterilisation</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Microchipping and licensing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Veterinary attention&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Dealing with missing pets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Pet Owner etiquette&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Care for community animals &amp; animal welfare</u>
</p>
<p>Nature Kakis can educate residents on best practices for interacting with
and caring for common community animals such as community cats and free-roaming
dogs. The topics covered could include:</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Responsible community animal feeding</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Living harmoniously with community animals</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Engaging the community as a whole</u>
</p>
<p>Encouraging community engagement through pet-related events and exhibitions
is an effective way to educate residents about responsible pet ownership.
With AVS's Pets' Day Out serves as a potential model for reference, Nature
Kakis are encouraged to plan and execute events tailored to their community,
including social media campaigns and collaboration with pet interest groups
to foster engagement.</p>

<p>Community Gardens are great spaces to involve people in greening their
neighbourhood, to learn about plants, and to organise nature-related activities
and events. Nature Kakis have been collaborating with Community Gardens
under the Community In Bloom programme to engage their communities through
gardening. See how they have grown <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-in-bloom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Many parks in Singapore are part of the Friends of The Parks programme,
in which localised volunteer groups help to maintain, improve, and advocate
for the responsible use of our green spaces. Nature Kakis groups have collaborated
with them to bring more communities to green spaces near them, and to learn
about nature in their own backyards. Check out their collaborations <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/friends-of-the-parks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Nature can be found everywhere in Singapore, including our urban areas!
By running projects close to home, Nature Kakis have been invaluable touchpoints
for their communities to learn about and experience nature right at their
doorstep. Visit some of their neighbourhoods and learn about their projects

<p>With an extensive network of parks, gardens, nature reserves and park
connectors, Singapore has a wide variety of green spaces for communities
to explore. Nature Kakis have been organising walks for their communities
based on their interests, and have even combined walks with other activities
like beach cleanups to make our green spaces even better. Read about their
efforts to take nature walks one step further <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The OneMillionTrees movement is a nationwide effort to plant a million
more trees across Singapore over the next 10 years, bringing the number
of trees in Singapore to more than 8 million. Nature Kakis are key players
in this movement by serving as facilitators and organisers of tree planting
activities within their constituencies. Dig into their activities <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/tree-planting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Nature is a great stress reliever. Interacting with natural materials
and green spaces has been proven to have a host of health benefits, such
as improving mental well-being, encouraging the young and elderly to improve
their motor skills, and serving as the basis of positive social interactions.
Nature Kakis have been conducting therapeutic horticulture activities for
their communities to bring all these benefits home. Check out how they
craft their own connections <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/therapeutic-horticulture/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
