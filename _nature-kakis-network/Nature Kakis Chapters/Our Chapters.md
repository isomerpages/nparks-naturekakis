Find out more on the type of Nature Kakis programming you can partake in as a Nature Kakis volunteer or resident by referring to our brochure here.<br></p>
	<p align="justify">As part of our initiative, we will partner with you and provide training to help you and other community leaders set up Nature Kakis chapters in each constituency. These small groups will organise various greenery and City in Nature-related activities such as tree-planting and guided walks for the community.<br></p>
