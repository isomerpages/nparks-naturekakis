<p>Singapore is home to a wide array of <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/wildlife-in-singapore/species-list" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fascinating animals</a> all
over the island. With habitats ranging from primary forests in our nature
reserves, mangroves and seagrass along our coastlines, and even greenery
among our urban cityscapes, wildlife has become an integral part of our
City in Nature.</p>
<p>Nature Kakis are an important conduit for residents to learn more about
wildlife on our island. By bringing their communities to see animals via
<a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Walks</a>, painting homages to them as part of <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-in-neighbourhood/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature in Neighbourhood</a> projects,
and planting <a href="https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">biodiversity-attracting plants</a> as
part of <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-in-bloom/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community In Bloom</a> or
<a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/tree-planting/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OneMillionTrees</a>, Nature Kakis Chapters can provide opportunities for
Singaporeans to learn about wildlife from their peers. This role also extends
into educating communities on how to behave around wildlife, which is integral
in managing <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/dos-and-donts/animal-advisories" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">human-wildlife conflict.</a>

<p>Nature Kakis chapters can join a <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/community-in-nature-initiative/citizen-science-programmes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Citizen Science Survey</a> and
learn more about biodiversity such as birds, butterflies, dragonflies,
and marine creatures in intertidal areas. By learning to identify and document
these animals, Nature Kakis can then level up to use the knowledge to teach
others in their community, and become more aware of the wildlife around
them.</p>
