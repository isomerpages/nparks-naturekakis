<p>As a City In Nature, Singapore has a wide variety of green spaces for
everyone to explore, ranging from <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/our-ecosystems/nature-areas-and-nature-reserves" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Reserves</a> and
<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/nature-park-network" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Parks</a>that serve as important habitat for sensitive wildlife,
<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">parks and gardens</a>for communities to enjoy, and an extensive <a href="/https://pcn.nparks.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Park Connector Network</a> that
links everything together.</p>
<p>Nature Kaki Chapters have brought their communities to enjoy these green
spaces through their walks, led by the Nature Kakis themselves or in collaboration
with guides from <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/friends-of-the-parks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Friends of the Parks</a> or
other environmental groups.</p>

<h3>Beyond just walks</h3>
<p>Nature Kakis Chapters have gone a step further by combining their nature
walks with other activities. Nature Kakis have used walks to talk about
local <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/biodiversity-and-wildlife/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">biodiversity</a>,
teach participants about the <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/therapeutic-horticulture/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">therapeutic</a> value
of green spaces, taken to the water on kayaks, conducted cleanups, and
brought along their <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-animals/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pets</a>. By exploring
their community's interests and needs, Nature Kakis have created novel
ways of getting their communities to interact with nature through these
walks.</p>
