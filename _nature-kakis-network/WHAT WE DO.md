<p>Nature Kakis chapters are key leaders within their constituency, driving
community-led nature programmes, activities, and projects, bringing our
City In Nature to their communities. They can explore a wide variety of
activities and programmes, catering to diverse interests and skill levels,
providing a starting point for Nature Kakis chapters to explore new activities
for their community. While the list is not exhaustive, it serves as a source
of inspiration for chapters to kickstart new programmes and/or improve
existing ones. If you join us as a Nature Kakis steward, you will have
the opportunity to participate in the following activities!</p>

<p>Community Gardens are great spaces to involve people in greening their
neighbourhood, to learn about plants, and to organise nature-related activities
and events. Nature Kakis have been collaborating with Community Gardens
under the Community In Bloom programme to engage their communities through
gardening. See how they have grown <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-in-bloom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Friends of the Park</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many parks in Singapore are part of the Friends of The Parks programme,
in which localised volunteer groups help to maintain, improve, and advocate
for the responsible use of our green spaces. Nature Kakis groups have collaborated
with them to bring more communities to green spaces near them, and to learn
about nature in their own backyards. Check out their collaborations <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/friends-of-the-parks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Nature can be found everywhere in Singapore, including our urban areas!
By running projects close to home, Nature Kakis have been invaluable touchpoints
for their communities to learn about and experience nature right at their
doorstep. Visit some of their neighbourhoods and learn about their projects

<p>With an extensive network of parks, gardens, nature reserves and park
connectors, Singapore has a wide variety of green spaces for communities
to explore. Nature Kakis have been organising walks for their communities
based on their interests, and have even combined walks with other activities
like beach cleanups to make our green spaces even better. Read about their
efforts to take nature walks one step further <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The OneMillionTrees movement is a nationwide effort to plant a million
more trees across Singapore over the next 10 years, bringing the number
of trees in Singapore to more than 8 million. Nature Kakis are key players
in this movement by serving as facilitators and organisers of tree planting
activities within their constituencies. Dig into their activities <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/tree-planting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Nature is a great stress reliever. Interacting with natural materials
and green spaces has been proven to have a host of health benefits, such
as improving mental well-being, encouraging the young and elderly to improve
their motor skills, and serving as the basis of positive social interactions.
Nature Kakis have been conducting therapeutic horticulture activities for
their communities to bring all these benefits home. Check out how they
craft their own connections <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/therapeutic-horticulture/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
