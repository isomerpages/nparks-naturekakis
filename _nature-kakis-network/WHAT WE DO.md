<p>The OneMillionTrees movement is a key strategy in achieving Singaporeâ€™s
City in Nature vision, where everyone can play a role in intensifying the
greenery in Singapore to build climate resilience. By planting one million
more trees by 2030 to tackle climate change, we are also reaping environmental
benefits such as cleaner water, fresher air, cooler urban temperatures
and better health and well-being.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kakis can organise and run tree planting sessions for the community
and get trained as OneMillionTrees facilitators to conduct tree planting
sessions for their residents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kakis Chapters can also take this opportunity to grow their pool
of volunteers equipped to be tree planting facilitators to teach participants
the basics of tree planting while ensuring that the planting is carried
out in a safe manner.</p>
