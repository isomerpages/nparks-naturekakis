<p>Promoting responsible pet ownership and community animal caregiving is
essential for improving animal health and welfare in our urban environment.
Nature Kakis chapters can conduct educational outreach to raise awareness
of current pet care guidelines and etiquette, while encouraging responsible
practices towards community animals. This initiative aims to engage and
educate the community on responsible pet ownership, cultivate neighbourliness
and tolerance for pets and community animals, and address animal-related
issues within the community.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Educational Outreach Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Responsible pet ownership</u>
</p>
<p>Nature Kakis can organize educational programmes for current and potential
pet owners, focusing on responsible pet ownership and spreading awareness
of AVS guidelines and recommendations for pet care. These guidelines may
cover topics such as sterilisation, microchipping, licensing and pet owner
etiquette. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Care for community animals &amp; animal welfare</u>
</p>
<p>Nature Kakis can educate residents on best practices for interacting with
and caring for common community animals such as community cats and free-roaming
dogs. The topics covered could include responsible community animal feeding
and Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM).</p>
<p><u>Engaging the community as a whole</u>
</p>
<p>Nature Kakis may plan and execute engagement events tailored to their
community, including social media campaigns and collaboration with pet
interest groups.</p>

<p>Community in Bloom</p>
<p>[insert banner]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Community in Bloom is a nationwide gardening movement started by NParks
in May 2005, aimed at promoting community spirit and a gardening culture
among Singapore residents, young and old. NParks provides horticultural
guidance and advice on community gardening alongside the public, private
sector, organisations, and volunteers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the Community in Bloom programme, Nature Kaki chapters can
champion or co-lead with the members to develop community gardens in their
precinct and plan activities to encourage residents and volunteers to participate
in gardening activities together. Community gardens are common green spaces
to encourage residents to come together to create, develop and sustain
a garden in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kaki chapters can also take the opportunity to empower more community
gardeners to share their experiences with the community through workshops
and talks.</p>

<p>The transformation of Singapore into a City in Nature, the increase in
our island’s greenery needs to be underpinned by the support of the community.
Involving the wider community in the development and management of our
green spaces can help to foster a greater sense of responsibility and stewardship
towards our parks and reserves. This also ensures that our green and blue
spaces are more inclusive and enjoyable to the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Friends of the Parks is a ground-led initiative that sets out to achieve
the objectives laid out above. The initiative consists of localised communities
representing stakeholders and volunteers of the parks and nature spaces.
The Friends of the Parks community allows Friends to play a more active
role that encourages graciousness through ground-led initiatives to create
an inclusive and enjoyable park experience. These initiatives come under
the three community engagement areas listed below –</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Conceptualisation and Park Design</strong> by
engaging the community to reimagine their park experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Park Development </strong>by involving
stakeholders and residents in the construction of the park through community-based
activities such as tree planting, habitat enhancement, installation/painting
of amenities and design of interpretative signage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Park Management</strong> by empowering
the community to co-organise activities and events, as well as play the
role of an active advocator to encourage responsible park usage.</p>

<p>Nature in Neighbourhood</p>
<p><em>[Insert Banner]</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature in the Neighbourhood programmes provide a platform for Nature Kakis
to unleash their creativity in curating activities for their community.
Chapters can brainstorm and devise innovative ways for residents to engage
with nature in their neighbourhood, such as organizing nature mural painting,
planning interactive games and gamifying using Bingo cards and Nature Podcast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some suggested considerations for Nature Kakis to keep in mind
while planning such programs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gather opinions and views:</strong>
</p>
<p>Collectively, Nature Kakis Chapter should first determine the topic and
target group for their community involvement before deciding on the method
of engagement, type and purpose of the activity to plan out for their community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Leverage existing resources, infrastructure, and community groups in the constituency:</strong>
</p>
<p>Chapters can then craft activities based on the natural opportunities
available in the neighborhood, making use of the community groups already
present in the area and surrounding green spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Engage subject experts and vendors to provide specialised knowledge, guidance and resource for successful event execution: &nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>If and where required, chapters can consult and seek expertise on areas
such as mural painting or event logistics, as well as sourcing necessary
materials and equipment from reliable vendors.</p>

<p>Nature Walks</p>
<p>[insert banner]</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>With the transformation of Singapore into a City in Nature, all households
will be a 10-minute walk from a park by 2030, bringing nature closer to
our homes. Giving guided and informative nature walks will help the community
gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the flora and fauna in
their backyard and encourage them to spend time outdoors to enjoy the beauty
and tranquil of the greenery close to their homes.</p>
<p>Through our capacity building programmes, Nature Kakis can curate and
conduct nature walks for the community, and/or assist in curating or facilitating
nature walks organised by other Nature Kakis chapters within their vicinity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s a recommended approach to preparing and executing a guided nature
walk:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify a green space, park or garden</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Define your target audience</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Define the focus of your guided walk</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit relevant supplementary resources</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct a recce trip to the site</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set a date and time and publicise event to potential participants</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct a briefing before the walk</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct the walk with confidence and enthusiasm, while reiterating park etiquette and regulations</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct a post-activity debrief</strong>
</p>

<p>The OneMillionTrees movement is a key strategy in achieving Singapore’s
City in Nature vision, where everyone can play a role in intensifying the
greenery in Singapore. By planting more trees, we tackle climate change
while benefitting from the ecosystem services trees provide such as cleaner
water, fresher air, cooler urban temperatures and better health and well-being.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to planting one million more trees by 2030, the OneMillionTrees
movement also aims to involve the community through participation in greening
initiatives.</p>
<p>Nature Kakis can organise and run tree planting sessions for the community,
as well as train and grow a pool of volunteers equipped to be tree plant
facilitators.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kakis can also be trained as OneMillionTrees facilitators to conduct
tree planting sessions for their residents. During the tree planting session,
facilitators will teach participants the basics of tree planting while
ensuring that the planting is carried out in a safe manner. In addition
to teaching proper tree planting techniques, facilitators will also share
about the OneMillionTrees movement, how it contributes to our City in Nature
vision which is a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Facilitators
may also personalise the tree planting experience for their participants
while helping them see the significance of their contribution and encouraging
them to share their experience with others.</p>

<p>Nature, greenery, and its benefits should be enjoyed by all, regardless
of age or ability. Therapeutic horticulture programmes are specially designed
to be accessible and beneficial for elderly groups, persons with dementia
and persons with special needs, promoting health and mental well-being.</p>
<p>Nature Kakis chapters can organise Therapeutic Horticulture programmes
to bring nature closer to these groups of people in the community, as well
as assist in facilitating Therapeutic Horticulture programmes in NParks
organized activities or at senior care centres within the community.</p>
<p>There are several Therapeutic Horticulture programmes that Nature Kakis
can organise. Some of the possible programmes are illustrated below:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Propagation of Edible plants</p>
