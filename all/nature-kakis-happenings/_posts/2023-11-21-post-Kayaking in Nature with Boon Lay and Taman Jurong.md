<p>On 29th October 2023, <a href="/all/chapters/boon-lay/">Nature Kakis @ Boon Lay</a>, <a href="">Green@Heart</a>, and Boon Lay CSN jointly organised the "Kayak In Nature" event at the Jurong Lake Gardens</p>
<p>Guided by the Nature Kakis and volunteers from PassionWave, 30 participants paddled through the waters of the Chinese and Japanese gardens, observing biodiversity and admiring the greenery of the gardens.</p>
<p>Some highlights of the activity include observing White-Bellied sea eagles soaring overhead, and learning about the prop roots of trees growing by the waters edge.</p>
