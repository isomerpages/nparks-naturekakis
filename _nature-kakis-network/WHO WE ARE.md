<p>The Nature Kakis initiative is a network of chapters that form touchpoints
centred at the heart of local communities. This platform aims to encourage
greater appreciation and community stewardship of nature. The objective
of this initiative is for Nature Kakis Chapters to be established island-wide
where they can self-organise and lead City in Nature-related projects and
programmes, for the community and by the community and with support from
partners, grassroots organisations and agencies including National Parks
Board (NParks) and People’s Association (PA).&nbsp;Each Nature Kakis Chapter
will be community-driven and brings together individuals who share a passion
for nature and conservation.</p>
