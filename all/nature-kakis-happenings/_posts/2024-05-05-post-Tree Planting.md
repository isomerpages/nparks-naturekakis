<p>The <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement/about-the-movement" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OneMillionTrees movement</a> is
a nationwide effort to plant a million more trees across Singapore over
the next 10 years, bringing the number of trees in Singapore to more than
8 million. Nature Kakis are helping NParks reach this goal by serving as
facilitators during community tree planting sessions, guiding residents
and other members of the public how to plant trees safely, and of their
importance in Singapore's landscape.</p>
<p>In addition to facilitating tree plantings, Nature Kaki chapters often
organise fringe activities before and after the tree plantings in their
<a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-in-neighbourhood/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">neighbourhoods</a>to get more residents involved, and to get them interested
in nature. Some fun examples include plant giveaways and games.</p>
