To make use of this progress and their capabilities, we encourage Nature Kakis to consistently bring more City in Nature initiatives into the heartlands and lead these activities for the community, by the community.</p><p>It is recommended for chapters to chart a work plan consisting of programmes to conduct, programme schedules, trainings and materials required to conduct each programme, as well as resources such as budget and manpower to organise these programmes at the beginning of the year. The chapters should also leverage on the ‘<a href="/seed-fund/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Kakis Seed Fund</a>’ to fund and facilitate the preparation and implementation of the programmes.</p>
