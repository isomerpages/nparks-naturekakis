<p>The Pulai Eco-Club is based in Telok Blangah, and has a keen interest
in promoting environmental empathy, raising awareness, and building a greener,
zero-waste community.</p>
<p>They have organised beach cleanups that double as intertidal walks, forest
walks, and sustainability dialogues about food. In addition, they have
a badge system for Telok Blangah and West Coast residents to encourage
participate in their events, with unique badges for each sphere of interest
that participants can collect.</p>
