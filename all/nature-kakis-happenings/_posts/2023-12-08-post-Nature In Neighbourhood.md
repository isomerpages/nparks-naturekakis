Nature Kakis chapters across Singapore are key advocated in their neighbourhoods as they educate residents about biodiversity, community animals, and gardening.</p><h3>Nature In Neighbourhood projects</h3><p>Every neighbourhood is unique! Nature Kakis Chapters have been creatively running a wide variety of projects to get residents in touch with nature around them. Some examples include:</p><h4>Mural painting in void decks</h4><p>In Boon Lay, the resident Nature Kakis have worked with their Town Council to paint wall murals about local plants and animals to liven up their spaces, and give passerby opportunities to learn about the flora and fauna around them. Drawing on the same concept, they have since expanded the murals to include one to serve as a feeding station for community cats as part of their efforts to look after community animals.</p><h4>Gamifying nature activities</h4><p>The Marymount Nature Kakis have created a bingo game to bring residents together and motivate them to try some activities related to nature, like gardening, how to interact with wildlife, and bird and butterfly identification. In collaboration with the <a href="https://fotp.nparks.gov.sg/fobamkp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Friends of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park</a> and <a href="https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/programming/cib-ambassadors/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community In Bloom Ambassadors</a>, residents got to fun, bite-sized tasters of what nature in their nieghbourhood had to offer.</p><p></p>
