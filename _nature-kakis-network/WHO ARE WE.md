<p>The Nature Kakis initiative is a network of chapters formed within the
constituencies to be touchpoints within the grassroots for community-led
City in Nature initiatives. This platform aims to accelerate the mainstreaming
of nature programmes into the heartlands to encourage greater appreciation
and community stewardship of nature. The eventual aim is to establish Nature
Kakis chapters in each constituency that can self-organise and lead projects,
for the community, by the community, with support from partners, grassroots
organisations and agencies including National Parks Board (NParks) and
Peopleâ€™s Association (PA). Each Nature Kakis chapter will be community-driven
and bring together individuals who share a passion for nature and conservation.</p>
