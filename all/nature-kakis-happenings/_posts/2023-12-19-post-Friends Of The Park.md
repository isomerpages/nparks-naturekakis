<p>The <a href="https://fotp.nparks.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Friends of the park</a> initiative consist of localised groups of volunteers that run grounds-up programmes in each of their parks. Every park's friends group is unique; some help to maintain the greenery of the park, while others educate the public on responsible park use, and some even run <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Walks</a> in the park itself. Nature Kakis can collaborate with nearby Friends of the Park groups to run programmes and activities to immerse their communities in these green spaces.</p><h3>Collaborations with Friends of The Park</h3><h4>Maintaining greenery</h4><p>Keeping a park looking nice takes work! Nature Kaki chapters can help to keep greenery neat and weed-free, and organise cleanups to keep parks litter-free.</p><h4>Outreach</h4><p>Sometimes residents don't know about the parks in their backyard. Nature Kakis Chapters can collaborate with their nearest Friends of the Park to run a Nature Walk, or engage nearby residents with an outreach booth.</p><p></p>
