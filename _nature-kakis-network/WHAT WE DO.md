<p><strong>Community in Bloom</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>[insert banner]</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Community in Bloom is a nationwide gardening movement started by NParks
in May 2005, aimed at promoting community spirit and a gardening culture
among Singapore residents, young and old.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the Community in Bloom programme, Nature Kaki chapters can
champion or co-lead with community gardeners to develop community gardens
in their precinct and plan activities to encourage residents and volunteers
to participate in gardening activities together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kaki chapters can also take the opportunity to empower more community
gardeners to share their experiences with the community through workshops
and talks.</p>

<p>Friends of the Parks is a ground-led initiative that sets out to involve
the wider community in the development and management of our green spaces
by choosing to be involved in the following community engagement areas:</p>
<p></p>

engaging the community to reimagine their park experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Park Development </strong>by involving
stakeholders and residents in the construction of the park through community-based
activities such as tree planting, habitat enhancement, installation/painting
of amenities and design of interpretative signage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Park Management</strong> by empowering

<p><strong>Nature in Neighbourhood</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>[Insert Banner]</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature in the Neighbourhood programmes provide a platform for Nature Kakis
to unleash their creativity in curating activities for their community.
Chapters can brainstorm and devise innovative ways for residents to engage
with nature in their neighbourhood, such as organizing nature mural painting,
planning interactive games and gamifying using Bingo cards and Nature Podcast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some suggested considerations for Nature Kakis to keep in mind
while planning such programs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gather opinions and views:</strong>
</p>
<p>Collectively, Nature Kakis Chapter should first determine the topic and
target group for their community involvement before deciding on the method
of engagement, type and purpose of the activity to plan out for their community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Leverage existing resources, infrastructure, and community groups in the constituency:</strong>
</p>
<p>Chapters can then craft activities based on the natural opportunities
available in the neighborhood, making use of the community groups already
present in the area and surrounding green spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Engage subject experts and vendors to provide specialised knowledge, guidance and resource for successful event execution: &nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>If and where required, chapters can consult and seek expertise on areas
such as mural painting or event logistics, as well as sourcing necessary
materials and equipment from reliable vendors.</p>

<p><strong>Nature Walks</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>[insert banner]</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the transformation of Singapore into a City in Nature, all households
will be a 10-minute walk from a park by 2030, bringing nature closer to
our homes. Giving guided and informative nature walks will help the community
gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the flora and fauna in
their backyard and encourage them to spend time outdoors to enjoy the beauty
and tranquil of the greenery close to their homes.</p>
<p>Through our capacity building programmes, Nature Kakis can curate and
conduct nature walks for the community, and/or assist in curating or facilitating
nature walks organised by other Nature Kakis chapters within their vicinity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s a recommended approach to preparing and executing a guided nature
walk:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify a green space, park or garden</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Define your target audience</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Define the focus of your guided walk</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit relevant supplementary resources</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct a recce trip to the site</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set a date and time and publicise event to potential participants</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct a briefing before the walk</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct the walk with confidence and enthusiasm, while reiterating park etiquette and regulations</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct a post-activity debrief</strong>

<p>The OneMillionTrees movement is a key strategy in achieving Singapore’s
City in Nature vision, where everyone can play a role in intensifying the
greenery in Singapore. By planting more trees, we tackle climate change
while benefitting from the ecosystem services trees provide such as cleaner
water, fresher air, cooler urban temperatures and better health and well-being.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to planting one million more trees by 2030, the OneMillionTrees
movement also aims to involve the community through participation in greening
initiatives.</p>
<p>Nature Kakis can organise and run tree planting sessions for the community,
as well as train and grow a pool of volunteers equipped to be tree plant
facilitators.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kakis can also be trained as OneMillionTrees facilitators to conduct
tree planting sessions for their residents. During the tree planting session,
facilitators will teach participants the basics of tree planting while
ensuring that the planting is carried out in a safe manner. In addition
to teaching proper tree planting techniques, facilitators will also share
about the OneMillionTrees movement, how it contributes to our City in Nature
vision which is a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Facilitators
may also personalise the tree planting experience for their participants
while helping them see the significance of their contribution and encouraging
them to share their experience with others.</p>

of age or ability. Therapeutic horticulture programmes are specially designed

<p>Nature Kakis chapters can organise Therapeutic Horticulture programmes
to bring nature closer to these groups of people in the community, as well
as assist in facilitating Therapeutic Horticulture programmes in NParks
organized activities or at senior care centres within the community.</p>
<p>There are several Therapeutic Horticulture programmes that Nature Kakis
can organise. Some of the possible programmes are illustrated below:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Propagation of Edible plants</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gardening (Pruning/Watering/Weeding)</p>
