<p>Pets and community animals are an important part of many people's lives,
and are also an integral part of many communities.</p>
<p>Nature Kakis can conduct educational outreach to raise awareness of current
pet care guidelines and etiquette, while encouraging responsible practices
towards community animals. Through related activities, they can engage
and educate the community on responsible pet ownership and cultivate neighbourliness
by bringing people together to raise awareness to care about community
animals.</p>
<h3>Community Animal projects</h3>
<h4>Managing Community Cats Feeding</h4>
<p>Many communities have dedicated volunteers that look after and feed community
cats. Nature Kakis can help to designate a feeding corner as a <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-in-neighbourhood/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature in Neighbourhood</a> project,
or raising awareness of responsible feeding practices will help to keep
common spaces clean, and cats well-fed and safe.</p>

<h4>Community pet walks</h4>
<p>Why not go on a <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Walk</a> with
your community and its pets? Nature Kakis have organised community pet
walks as a way to bond with your neighbours, and encourage fellow pet owners
to learn better leash discipline and <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/resources/pets-animals-dos-and-donts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pet etiquette</a>.
Take note that while pets can be taken to most green spaces, they are not
allowed in Nature Parks and Nature Reserves as these spaces have sensitive
wildlife.</p>
<h4>Improving pet welfare</h4>
<p>Knowledge is power! Nature Kakis Chapters can become hubs for information
on <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/pets/owning-a-pet/getting-a-pet/what-to-consider-before-you-get-a-pet" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">responsible pet ownership</a>,
and give tips on how to improve the welfare of pet animals. By sharing
best practices on proper animal care, communities can improve the lives
of the animals.</p>

<h4>Raising awareness about the illegal wildlife trade</h4>
<p>Not all animals can be kept as pets! It is <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/animals/wildlife-and-endangered-animals/keeping-of-wildlife-as-pets" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">illegal to keep wildlife as pets</a>,
and purchasing such animals will continue to fuel the illegal wildlife
trade. Raising awareness on what animals are considered suitable for pet
ownership will also help to reduce incidences of poaching, which in turn
will help <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/biodiversity-and-wildlife/-and-wildlife/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">wildlife</a> in
Singapore and beyond.</p>
