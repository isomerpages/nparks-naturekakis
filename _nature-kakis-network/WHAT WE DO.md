<p>With the transformation of Singapore into a City in Nature, all households
will be a 10-minute walk from a park by 2030, bringing nature closer to
our homes. Giving guided and informative nature walks will help the community
gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the flora and fauna in
their backyard and encourage them to spend time outdoors to enjoy the beauty
and tranquil of the greenery close to their homes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through our capacity building programmes, Nature Kakis can curate and
conduct nature walks for the community, and/or assist in curating or facilitating
nature walks organised by other Nature Kakis chapters within their vicinity.</p>

<p>The OneMillionTrees movement is a key strategy in achieving Singapore’s
City in Nature vision, where everyone can play a role in intensifying the
greenery in Singapore to build climate resilence. By planting one million
more trees by 2030, we tackle climate change while benefitting from the
ecosystem services trees provide such as cleaner water, fresher air, cooler
urban temperatures and better health and well-being.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kakis can organise and run tree planting sessions for the community
and get trained as OneMillionTrees facilitators to conduct tree planting
sessions for their residents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kakis Chapters can also take this opportunity to grow their pool
of volunteers equipped to be tree plant facilitators to teach participants
the basics of tree planting while ensuring that the planting is carried
out in a safe manner.</p>
