<p>In support of the OneMillionTrees Movement, the Punggol Coast Nature Kakis co-organised a tree-planting event where the Nature Kakis facilitators guided Punggol residents to plant trees alongside Punggol North Avenue on 24 September 2023.</p>
<p>Grassroots Adviser, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, joined around 80 of the residents, a good mix of young families and seniors from the Punggol Active Ageing Committee, to plant a total of 60 trees. The tree species planted were Ardisia elliptica, Tarenna fragrans and Memecylon ovatum.</p>
