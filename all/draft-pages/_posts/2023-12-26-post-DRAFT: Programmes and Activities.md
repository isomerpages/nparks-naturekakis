By engaging communities about biodiversity and wildlife, Nature Kakis help communities to appreciate our wild friends through walks, neighbourhood projects, outreach activities and more. Check out how they have embraced the wild side <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/biodiversity-and-wildlife/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><h2>Community Animals</h2><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Community animals/cam2dog_Resized.jpg"></div><p>Pets are a communityâ€™s best friend!

Nature Kakis have been collaborating with Community Gardens under the Community In Bloom programme to engage their communities through gardening. See how they have grown <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-in-bloom/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><h2>Friends of The Parks</h2><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/FOTP/aywi5915.JPG"></div><p>Many parks in Singapore are part of the Friends of The Parks programme, in which localised volunteer groups help to maintain, improve, and advocate for the responsible use of our green spaces. Nature Kakis groups have collaborated with them to bring more communities to green spaces near them, and to learn about nature in their own backyards. Check out their collaborations <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/friends-of-the-parks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h2>Nature In Neighbourhood</h2><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nature in neighborhood/nin1__2_.jpg"></div><p>Nature can be found everywhere in Singapore, including our urban areas! By running projects close to home, Nature Kakis have been invaluable touchpoints for their communities to learn about and experience nature right at their doorstep. Visit some of their neighbourhoods and learn about their projects <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-in-neighbourhood/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h2>Nature Walks</h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/DIY Nature walks/intertidal1.jpeg"></div><p></p><p>With an extensive network of parks, gardens, nature reserves and park connectors, Singapore has a wide variety of green spaces for communities to explore. Nature Kakis have been organising walks for their communities based on their interests, and have even combined walks with other activities like beach cleanups to make our green spaces even better. Read about their efforts to take nature walks one step further <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><h2>OneMillionTrees Movement</h2><p></p><p></p><h2>Therapeutic Horticulture</h2><p>Nature is a great stress reliever. Interacting with natural materials and green spaces has been proven to have a host of health benefits, such as improving mental well-being, encouraging the young and elderly to improve their motor skills, and serving as the basis of positive social interactions. Nature Kakis have been conducting therapeutic horticulture activities for their communities to bring all these benefits home. Check out how they craft their own connections <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/therapeutic-horticulture/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
