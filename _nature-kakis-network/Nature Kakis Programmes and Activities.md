Nature Kakis programmes uses plants and nature related activities to build and support Chapters with individuals who are passionate about appreciating, preserving and enhancing Singaporeâ€™s natural environment. To empower our Nature Kakis Network in organising City in Nature activities, we have developed a suite of programmes and activities that cater to a diverse range of interests and skill levels. We aim to inspire and engage individuals, while also providing them with the necessary tools and resources to become active stewards of nature.</p></section>
