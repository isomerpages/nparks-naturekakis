<h3>Building of Nature Kakis Network</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img alt="" src="/images/Groups Networking Engagement/Networking__1__Resized.jpg"></div><p>To support Nature Kakis chapters in their programmes, resources, subject matter expertise and trainings will be provided to the Nature Kakis chapters. National Parks Board (NParks) has developed a comprehensive framework for capacity building consisting of various opportunities in different mediums. The Nature Kakis Capacity Building Framework includes:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Nature Kakis 101 Induction programme</strong> series covering four topics annually on <em>biodiversity and wildlife; arboriculture; horticulture; and community engagement</em></p><p>These topics are designed to provide Nature Kakis with a comprehensive understanding of the issues related to nature and the community, as well as the skills they need to lead and facilitate City in Nature related activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Topic specific training sessions</strong> based on Nature Kakis chapters’ interests</p><p>The topic specific sessions are based on chapters’ interests and goes in-depth on nature conservation, human-wildlife matters, local biodiversity, gardening, therapeutic horticulture, and community animals.</p></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img alt="" src="/images/Groups Networking Engagement/Networking__1__Resized_2.jpg"></div><h4>Overview of the Nature Kakis capacity building framework</h4><p>Through our induction series and topic trainings, we aim to equip Nature Kakis with the skills and knowledge they need to plan and execute City in Nature related activities for their chapters.</p><p>The diagram below illustrates the overall timeline and framework to help train Nature Kakis in both theoretical and practical skills to aid in their programmes.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img alt="" src="/images/NK101indoverview.png"></div><p>* <em>The framework above serves as a guide; actual</em> <em>schedule of topics may vary yearly.</em></p><p>All trainings provided by NParks are provided for the purpose of enabling Nature Kakis to conduct self-run activities when they are capable to do so. As such, Nature Kakis chapters should do their part in conducting nature activities for their community after being equipped during the trainings.</p><h4>Training opportunities</h4><p>Nature Kakis will be invited to participate in the trainings as these sessions will provide them with hands-on experience in planning and facilitating events. Along with this, Nature Kakis will receive the opportunity to work with other experienced topic experts and community leaders whilst learning from one another.</p><p>Chapters may also learn more about engaging their community through targeted trainings sessions with subject experts. The training sessions will be arranged after the expression of interest by the chapters.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img alt="" src="/images/DIY Nature walks/GuideFacilitation_ChekJawa_20230805__1__Resized.jpg"></div><p><strong>Nature Kakis 101 Induction Talk Series</strong></p><p>This series of talks is designed to give Nature Kakis a launchpad into the work that NParks does and the role that Nature Kakis can play with regards to selected Nature Kakis programmes. Depending on the topic, the sessions could include hands-on interactive elements to help Nature Kakis internalise the content and advice shared by the speakers. The talks will be scheduled quarterly with each catering to a different topic. Nature Kakis are encouraged to attend this talk to learn more about new topics, gain deeper insight into NParks programmes, and ask any questions they might have to our esteemed speakers.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img alt="" src="/images/Groups Networking Engagement/Picture3__2_.png"></div><p><strong>Structured training programmes for Nature Kakis</strong></p><p>This suite of training opportunities is designed by the various NParks divisions specifically for the Nature Kakis network, serving to equip Nature Kakis practical skills and deeper knowledge of specific programmes.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img alt="" src="/images/DIY Nature walks/GuideFacilitation_ChekJawa_20230805__11__Resized.jpg"></div><p>See below for the Nature Kakis programmes with a brief overview of the activity.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Activity</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>What can Nature Kakis do?</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>DIY Nature Walks</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Participate in organised training walks to learn how to be a better Nature Guide.
