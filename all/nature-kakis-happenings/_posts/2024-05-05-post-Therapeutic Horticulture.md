<p>Therapeutic horticulture uses plants and nature-related activities to
improve the well-being of participants and. By interacting with nature,
participants can improve their motor skills, stimulate their memory, and
encourage positive social interactions with nature. Therapeutic horticulture
is particularly effective in engaging the elderly, people with dementia,
and people with special needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nature Kakis Chapters can learn how to conduct therapeutic horticulture
activities, bring communities to therapeutic gardens, and even incorporate
therapeutic garden elements closer to home to bring these benefits to their
communities.</p>
<h3>Therapeutic Horticulture Activities</h3>
<p>Simple activities like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix79Y-vnjyc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">propagating plants</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUxJNTL2m-A" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">leaf printing</a>, and making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3255iKu9lo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">seed mandalas</a> are
easy activities for communities to do together, with materials that can
be easily grown and harvested from a nearby Community Garden. Nature Kakis
can learn how to <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/therapeutic-gardens/how-to-start-a-therapeutic-horticulture-programme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">conduct these activities</a> and

<h3>Therapeutic Gardens</h3>
<p>In addition to the activities, Nature Kakis could go for a <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/nature-walks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nature Walk</a> in
a <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/therapeutic-gardens" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Therapeutic Garden</a> located
in a public park. These gardens are specially designed to be serene and
tranquil, serving as a key space of people to interact with nature in a
positive way. In addition to being wheelchair-accessible, many of these
gardens feature activity zones where Nature Kakis Chapters can conduct
therapeutic horticulture activities.</p>
