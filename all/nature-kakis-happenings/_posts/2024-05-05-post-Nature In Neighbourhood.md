<p>Nature Kakis can act as key advocates in their neighbourhoods as they
educate residents and the community about nature, through creative Nature
in Neighbourhood projects.</p>
<p>Below are some examples of Nature In Neighbourhood projects. These examples
are not exhaustive, and chapters are encouraged to explore and implement
various creative ideas to engage their community with nature.</p>
<h3>Nature In Neighbourhood projects</h3>
<h4>Mural painting in void decks</h4>
<p>Nature Kakis Chapters have worked with their Town Council to paint wall
murals about local plants and animals to liven up their spaces, and give
passerby opportunities to learn about the flora and fauna around them.
Drawing on the same concept, they have since expanded the murals to include
a feeding station for community cats as part of their efforts to look after

<h4>Outreach activities</h4>
<p>Because Nature Kakis Chapters are all led by grassroots organisations,
many of them have lots of experience in running outreach booths and activities
for their communities. Together with the community groups such as <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/friends-of-the-parks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Friends of the Parks</a> and
<a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-in-bloom/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community In Bloom</a>Ambassadors, some Nature Kakis Chapters engaged
residents with interactive activities to learn more about the flora and
fauna in their neighbouring parks and gardens. Animal-loving Nature Kakis
Chapters have also conducted outreach booths about local <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/biodiversity-and-wildlife/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">wildlife</a>,
and conducted resident engagement sessions to raise awareness about welfare
issues for <a href="/all/nature-kakis-happenings/community-animals/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">community and pet cats</a>.</p>
